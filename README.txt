FRONT-END WORK:

1. Since I should be spending most of time on the back-end portions of this project, I decided to go for a pretty simplistic design when tackling the styling of the app.
2. I made the app purple-themed and added a gif in the background to make a simple app not look boring.

BACK-END WORK:

1. I spent a very short time configuring node to read and write the html forms through JS.
2. I spent hours trying to figure out how to convert my form submissions into a JS array.
3. I got a little way through with node successfully reading and coverting the submissions into a JS array, but fell short.
4. I also had a lot of trouble getting my CSS to appear on the page whenever I started the server, but never got it to succesfully load.
